title: Webscraping Job Postings from Glassdoor
---

### Introduction

This week we are goin to scrape job postings from Glassdoor in order to get a sense of the salaries for data science jobs across the country.

### Assumptions

Lets look at how Billboard compiles its Hot 100 list since many of our assumptions will be due to Billboard's own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100#Year-end_charts">metrics</a>.


### Some of our risks: 

- The data set 

### Scraping


### Exploring the data / Munging

We reformatted quite a bit of the data. . 



### Some Initial Observations

Some interesting quirks arose while exploring the data. Most racks in the Hot 100 fell of the charts after week 20. All of these tracks were ranked below the top 50 when they exited. Additionally, tracks that remained in the charts beyond 20 weeks all exited the chart in the top 50.
