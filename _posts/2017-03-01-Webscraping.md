title: Webscraping Job Postings from Glassdoor
---

### Introduction

This week we are going to scrape job postings from Glassdoor in order to get a sense of the salaries for data science jobs across the country.

### Goals
- Scrape job postings from Glassdoor using beautiful soup. 

- Build a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a job will have a high salary. 

### Risks and Assumptions

Glassdoor is only one of many job search sites, but we are assuming that most advertised positions will be posted here. We are also assuming that Glassdoor's estimated salary range, included with most postings, gives us a good idea of the expected salary for each position.
