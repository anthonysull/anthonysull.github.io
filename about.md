An architect with a background in research based, iterative design. I am passionate about finding and processing relevant information, finding meaningful connections and providing/sharing useful insights that can drive the formation of innovative ideas.

I spent 10 years in architecture working in internationally recognized offices known for design innovation and am now looking to bring my analytical skills to machine learning.
